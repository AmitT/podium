Installation

### Install gulp

Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). We recommend you update to the latest version of yarn: `yarn self-update`.

From the command line:

1. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) globally with `yarn global add gulp`
2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run `yarn install`

### Build commands

* `yarn start` — Compile assets when file changes are made, start BrowserSync session
* `yarn run build` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `yarn run build:production` — Compile assets for production

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.
