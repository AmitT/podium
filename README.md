Installation

### Install gulp

Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). We recommend you update to the latest version of npm.

From the command line:

1. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) globally with `npm install -g gulp`
2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run `npm install`
3. Change your site URL in assets/config.json file devUrl.

### Build commands

* `npm start` — Compile assets & start BrowserSync session (listening to file changes, recompile & push changes to your browser).
* `npm run build:dev` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `npm run build` OR `npm run build:production` — Compile minified assets for production

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.
